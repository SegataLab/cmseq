## breadth_depth.py - Breadth and Depth of coverage

Provides breadth and depth of coverage the references of BAM alignment file, in tabular format. The file must be indexed and sorted (alternatively, --sortindex can be used).


```
usage: breadth_depth.py [-h] [-c REFERENCE ID] [-f] [--sortindex]
                        [--minlen MINLEN] [--minqual MINQUAL]
                        [--mincov MINCOV] [--truncate TRUNCATE]
                        BAMFILE
```


```
positional arguments:
  BAMFILE               The file on which to operate

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c REFERENCE ID, --contig REFERENCE ID
                        Focus on a subset of references in the BAM file. Can
                        be a list of references separated by commas or a FASTA
                        file (the IDs are used to subset)
  -f                    If set unmapped (FUNMAP), secondary (FSECONDARY), qc-
                        fail (FQCFAIL) and duplicate (FDUP) are excluded. If
                        unset ALL reads are considered (bedtools genomecov
                        style). Default: unset
  --sortindex           Sort and index the file
  --minlen MINLEN       Minimum Reference Length for a reference to be
                        considered
  --minqual MINQUAL     Minimum base quality. Bases with quality score lower
                        than this will be discarded. This is performed BEFORE
                        --mincov. Default: 30
  --mincov MINCOV       Minimum position coverage to perform the polymorphism
                        calculation. Position with a lower depth of coverage
                        will be discarded (i.e. considered as zero-coverage
                        positions). This is calculated AFTER --minqual.
                        Default: 1
  --truncate TRUNCATE   Number of nucleotides that are truncated at either
                        contigs end before calculating coverage values.

```
 

Breadh and Depth of coverage outputs a table with the breadth of coverage, average and median depth-of-coverage of each reference. Values are calculated only on the covered portion of the reference:

|contig|Breadth|Depth (avg)|Depth (median)|
|------|-------|-----------|--------------|
|EF401177.1.1491|0.101274312542|1.0|1.0|
|EF405039.1.1494|0.101070950469|2.69536423841|3.0|
|all_contigs|-|1.84768211921|1.0|

The last line is a summary line calculated as if all the reads were coming from the same (big) contig.

## polymut.py - Polymorphic rate over protein-coding genes

This function calculates polymorphic site rates over protein coding genes. It considers dominant and second-dominant alleles over protein-coding genes on the nucleotide level, translates the ORFs into proteins and then calculates and outputs the number of 
synonymous and non-synonymous mutations (on the protein level) between the dominant and second-dominant protein sequences. 
Positions with a ratio between second-dominant and dominant allele coverage smaller than dominant_frq_thrsh are considered non-variant. This function was used in the study by Pasolli et al., 2019 as an ad-hoc measure to calculate strain heterogeneity in metagenomes.
Since the likelihood of finding more than one strain in the same gut varies strongly across gut commensals (as well as different within-species genetic diversity), 
this function does not allow a rigorous classification of metagenomes into strain-mixed and non-strain-mixed, but it can be shown that - considering polymorphic site rates over i.e. core genes of any given speices - samples with a higher polymorphic site rate are more likely to
harbour more than one strain. 

Please supply a gff file from roary and make sure that the contig names between the bam file and the gff file can be matched.

The functions prints the number of non-synonymous mutations, synonymous mutations and the total number of considered positions (total number of positions covered higher than the parameter specified with --mincov) for each entry in your bam file
(or alternatively for each subset of entries/contigs supplied with -c)

### Examples ###

Calculate the number of non-synonymous, synonymous and the total number of considered positions (on the nucleotide level!) over your contig of interest.

```
python polymut.py -c "contig_of_interest" bam_of_interest.bam --mincov 10 --minqual 30 --dominant_frq_thrsh 0.8 --gff_file gff_from_roary.gff
```

## poly.py - Polymorphic Rate

Provides the Polymorphic-rate of each reference in a sorted and indexed BAMFILE. The polymorphic rate is defined as: number_of_polymorhpic_sites / number_of_total_nucleotides. Beware that *number_of_total_nucleotides* depends on --minqual and --mincov, as if a position is not covered (e.g. coverage = 0) will not be counted in the denominator.

                        --mincov. Default: 30
  --mincov MINCOV       Minimum position coverage to perform the polymorphism
                        calculation. Position with a lower depth of coverage
                        will be discarded (i.e. considered as zero-coverage
                        positions). This is calculated AFTER --minqual.
                        Default:1
  --pvalue PVALUE       Binomial p-value threshold for the binomal-polymorphic
                        test. Default: 0.01

```

The output is strucutred as follows:

|-GENOME-|0.65|0.67|…|0.04|302.00|13.00|0.04|

As for ``breadh_depth.py``, also the polymorphic rate analyisis is subjected to ``mincov``, ``minqual``, and ``minlen``. Additionally, two parameters can be set to decide when a site is polymorphic:


* ``dominant_frq_thrsh`` is a percentage: if the majoritary allele frequency at position x is greater than the threshold, x is considered non-polymorphic. Otherwise, a binomial test is performed to assure that x is polymorpfic (polymorphic if p < ``pvalue``)


### Examples ###

Extract polymorphic rate from a sorted and indexed bam file 


```
poly.py mybam.sorted.bam
```


Extract polymorphic rate from an unsorted bam file 


```
poly.py --sortindex mybam.sorted.bam 
```


Extract polymorphic rate from an unsorted bam file, counting only bases with minimum quality of 30 and minimum position-coverage of 10


```
poly.py --sortindex --mincov 10 --minqual 30 mybam.unsorted.bam
```


Extract polymorphic rate from an unsorted bam file, only for reads aligning against genome_1 or genome_2. Consider polymorphic only sites with majoritary-allele-freq < 70%


```
poly.py --sortindex -c genome_1,genome_2 --dominant_frq_thrsh 0.7 mybam.unsorted.bam
```

 
## consensus.py - Reference Free (but guided) consensis

Provides the Reference Free consensus for the references in a BAM alignment file, reconstructing the sequence from the raw reads, in FASTA format to standard output. The file must be indexed and sorted (alternatively, --sortindex can be used). Note that the length of the reconstructed sequence is bound to the original length of the reference. On that length, not all the positions may be covered. This can happen because:

* there are no reads mapping to the position
* there are too few reads (*i.e < ``mincov``*) mapping to the position
* the reads that map to the position have a low quality (*i.e. < ``minqual``*)
* the distribution of nucleotides at that position is potentially problematic (*i.e. dominant_allele_frequency < ``dominant_frq_thrsh``*): in this case, the position is excluded to reduce noise.


```

  --trim TRIM           Trim the reads before computing the consensus.

                        of each read will be ignored. Default: None

```
